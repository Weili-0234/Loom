<p align="center"><em>You drive Claude Code / Codex — Loom keeps the worktrees, plans, diffs, and notes tidy.</em></p>

**Loom** is a small web console for driving [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
(and Codex). You give a task a goal; Loom gives it a real terminal, turns the
goal into a `PLAN.md`, manages git worktrees, shows the diff, and pings you when
the agent needs input. There's no autonomous loop — **you drive the agent**;
Loom just keeps the bookkeeping tidy.

## Install

Loom needs **Python 3.10+**, **git**, **tmux**, and at least one agent CLI
(`claude`, `codex`, or Cursor's `agent`) that you have already logged into.

The package is `loom-console`; the command it installs is `loom`.

**With [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io)** — recommended, gets its own isolated
environment and works on Debian/Ubuntu where a plain `pip install` is blocked
by [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/):

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/FutureMLS-Lab/Loom.git
```

**With a virtualenv**, if you would rather manage it yourself:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/loom
~/.venvs/loom/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/FutureMLS-Lab/Loom.git
~/.venvs/loom/bin/loom --version
```

**From a source checkout**, for hacking on Loom itself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FutureMLS-Lab/Loom.git && cd Loom
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'    # [dev] adds pytest, so `pytest tests` works
```

## Quickstart

```bash
loom doctor                                 # check tmux / git / agent CLI
claude                                      # log in to the agent CLI once
loom web --project /path/to/your/project    # start the console
# → open http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

`loom doctor` is the first thing to run when something misbehaves: it reports
every external tool Loom depends on and tells you how to fix what is missing.
`loom web` refuses to start if tmux or git is absent, rather than handing you a
broken terminal.

## The basic flow

1. **+ Add folder** (top bar) — pick the repo you want to work in.
2. **Create Task** — give it a title and a one-line goal.
3. Open the task → **Start Claude**, and wait a few seconds for it to boot.
4. **Start Deep Interview** — answer its questions; it writes **`PLAN.md`**.
5. **Run /goal** — it works through the plan. Review in the **Changes** tab,
   click **Write result** to log progress back to `PLAN.md`, and repeat.

```
Create task ─▶ Start Claude ─▶ Deep Interview ─▶ Run /goal ─▶ Write result ─▶ (repeat)
```

When you're happy, **Push** the worktree or **Merge ↩** it from the Changes tab.

1. **Register your project.** Top bar → **+ Add folder**, pointed at a git repo
   (or a container directory holding several repos). Registrations live in
   `~/.loom/web-projects.json`; nothing is written outside the path.

2. **Create a task.** **Create Task** asks for a **type** (Claude, Codex, Kernel
   Lab, or AR), a **title** (becomes the slug), and a **general goal**. Loom
   creates `.RUD/<slug>/` with an empty `PLAN.md`; if the project root is a git
   repo it auto-creates a worktree at `.RUD/<slug>/work/<repo>/` on branch
   `zhongzhu/<slug>`.

3. **Start the agent.** Task → **Claude** tab → **Start Claude** launches a tmux
   pane running the agent CLI in the task's `work/` worktree. The pane keeps
   running even if you close the browser.

4. **Run the deep interview.** **Start Deep Interview** pastes a prompt (your
   goal + selected skills); the agent interviews you and writes the agreed plan
   to `PLAN.md`. Answer in the terminal (real terminal: type, ↑/↓ to pick, Enter).

5. **Review the plan** in the embedded read-only viewer (defaults to `PLAN.md`).

6. **Execute it** with **Run /goal**; answer any prompts right in the terminal.

7. **Review the changes** in the **Changes** tab (uncommitted + committed diff);
   optionally **Review ⚖** for an AI review against your rules / skills.

8. **Write the result** with **Write result** to append progress to `PLAN.md`,
   then iterate (repeat 6–8).

9. **Ship it.** Loom never auto-commits — the agent commits in the worktree (or
   you do); then **Push** the worktree, or **Merge ↩** its branch back into the
   base branch from the Changes tab.

10. **(Optional) Notify.** Flip **Notify** on the Monitor row so Loom pings you
    (e.g. in Slack via OpenClaw) when the agent stops and waits for input; your
    reply is typed straight back into the pane.

11. **(Later) Resume.** Pick a past session from the **Sessions** dropdown →
    **Resume** to reopen it in a fresh tmux pane, even if the original was killed.

## Run options

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--project PATH` | Project root. Defaults to `$PWD`. A git repo OR a container directory holding several git repos. |
| `--skills PATH` | Default skills markdown injected into every agent session. Defaults to `loom/skills/charlie_skills.md`. |
| `--projects` | Multi-project workspace: the launch dir is a container of repos. |
| `--auth-token TOKEN` | Require auth (HTTP basic / bearer; username ignored, password = token). Also reads `LOOM_WEB_AUTH_TOKEN`. |
| `--daemon` / `--nohup` | Run in the background. Logs land in `<project>/.RUD/web.log`. |
| `--openclaw …` | Optional [OpenClaw](#openclaw-integration) notifications + reply-back (full flags in `loom/cli.py`). |

```bash
loom doctor    # check prerequisites and report what's missing
loom init      # writes a minimal PLAN.md + NOTES.md in $PWD
loom update    # restart a running loom web from this checkout; tmux agents keep running
loom --version # installed version
loom --help    # all commands
```

To pick up new Loom code without killing agent panes (or a Turbogate URL started
outside Loom):

```bash
# after git pull / rsync into the checkout that is running:
loom update --port 8765            # restart from files already on disk
loom update --port 8765 --pull     # git pull --ff-only, then restart
loom update --port 8765 --dry-run  # print the plan only
```

The same action is the **Update Loom** button in the top bar. It SIGKILLs the
web process (so independently-started tunnels are not cleaned up) and execs
`python -m loom web` from the checkout's `.venv`. AR mine / idea / reviewer
jobs that are in-flight are not resumable and block the restart unless you
confirm.

(`.RUD/` is Loom's per-project task directory. The agent pane opens in `work/`.)

## Web UI reference

An agent task has two main tabs — **Claude** (or **Codex**) and **Changes** — plus
a read-only Markdown viewer (Kernel Lab tasks get their own panel). Every control:

| Where | Control | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Claude tab** | **Start / Stop Claude** | Launch / kill the tmux pane (agent CLI in the primary `work/` worktree). Stopping keeps sessions resumable. |
| | **Loom flow** | Three buttons — **Start Deep Interview** → **Run /goal** → **Write result** (each pastes a prompt; run any, anytime). |
| | **Terminal** | Real xterm.js on the live PTY: type, arrows, Enter, Esc, Ctrl-C, paste all go to the agent; mouse-wheel scrolls history. |
| | **中文 / compose box** | Type Chinese (input-method-safe) or long text → **Enter** sends it into the pane. |
| | **Copy / paste** | Copy: select + **Cmd/Ctrl+C** (or Ctrl+Shift+C). Paste: **Cmd/Ctrl+V** (or Ctrl+Shift+V). |
| | **Agent** | Switch Claude ⇄ Codex (while stopped). New Claude tasks default to `claude-opus-4-8`. |
| | **Skills** | Which skills markdown to inject (files under the skills dir). |
| | **Worktrees** | Dropdown of the task's worktrees + live `git status`; **Push** (selected), **×** remove, **+ Add worktree**, **Push all**. |
| | **tmux** | The live pane target + an alive/down pill. |
| | **Sessions** | Dropdown of past agent sessions (newest first) + **View** (transcript, including Claude Code subagent sessions nested under the parent) + **Resume**. |
| | **Monitor** | **Notify** toggle → pings you (OpenClaw/Slack) when the agent stops; your reply is typed back into the pane. |
| | **Markdown viewer** | Read-only preview of `PLAN.md` (or any top-level `*.md`). The agent writes PLAN.md; you `/goal` it in the pane. |
| **Changes tab** | **Diff** | Read-only VSCode-style diff: uncommitted (vs `HEAD`, incl. untracked) + committed (vs base, e.g. `origin/main`). |
| | **Merge ↩** | Merge the worktree's branch into the base — `git merge --no-ff`; refuses if dirty, aborts on conflicts, never pushes. |
| | **Review ⚖** | AI review (`claude -p`) of the diff vs your rules (toolbar box) or the task's skills. |
| **Top bar** | **+ Add folder** | Register a repo from the Loom launch directory. |
| | **📓 Notes** | Fullscreen editor for `<project>/.RUD/NOTES.md` (one per project). **Cmd/Ctrl+S** saves. |

**Run monitor (Notify):** edge-triggers on *running → stopped* — when the agent was
working (pane shows "esc to interrupt") then stops for input, Loom sends an OpenClaw
event with the tail of the pane; your reply is typed back in and you're pinged again
on the next stop. (Enabled while the pane is idle, it stays quiet until the agent
next runs and stops.)

### Task types

| Type | What it is |
|------|------------|
| **Claude / Codex** | The standard human-driven flow above. |
| **AR** | Automated research: turns a direction into paper ideas, then drives each idea from LaTeX draft to reviewed submission. See below. |
| **Kernel Lab** | Dedicated panel driving the Loom Kernel Hub evaluator (spec interview + build/run launcher with live log). Advanced / optional. |

#### AR — automated research

An AR task is one of two roles, both stored in `.RUD/<slug>/ar.json`.

A **studio** is what you create from the modal: pick a research direction and a
target venue (ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML or COLM), then either let it mine recent arXiv
work and propose ideas, or hand it a rough idea of your own to sharpen. Select
the ideas worth pursuing and Loom turns each one into its own task.

Each of those is a **paper** task, and it walks a fixed pipeline:

1. **Draft** — the author agent fills the venue's LaTeX skeleton. The experiments
   section gets its full structure but every number stays an `\ARnum{}` marker
   and every figure an `\ARfig{}` placeholder.
2. **Your review** — a gate. Approve to open the loop, or send it back with notes.
3. **Rounds** — by default ten of them. The author agent works in the task's tmux
   pane (revising the paper, running experiments locally in the worktree) and
   signals the end of its turn by writing `rounds/round-NN/author.md`. Loom then
   compiles the PDF and applies a hard readiness gate: no TODO/placeholder
   markers, missing figures, unresolved citations/references, incomplete core
   sections, build errors or visible `??` may remain. A blocked paper goes back
   to the author in the same round with the exact failed checks. Only a complete
   submission runs three independent Cursor reviewers headlessly:
   `gpt-5.6-sol-max`, `claude-fable-5-thinking-max`, and
   `cursor-grok-4.5-high`. Each reviewer sees an isolated workspace containing
   only the compiled PDF (never the LaTeX source). All reports are preserved;
   the lowest-Rating reviewer's complete score block is the final verdict. If
   that lowest score plateaus for three rounds, the fixed panel stays in place
   and the author must make a structural change. Two more rounds without
   improvement pause the loop for a human decision.
4. **Final review** — a gate. Approve to deliver and download the PDF, or send it
   back for another batch of rounds.

Round state lives on disk, so a round survives a killed pane or a server restart
and resumes where it left off. The methodology the agents follow is in
`loom/skills/ar/` (`AR-STUDIO.md`, `AR-AUTHOR.md`, `AR-REVIEWER.md`) — edit those
to change how the pipeline writes and reviews.

The venue LaTeX styles are vendored under `loom/templates/paper/<venue>/`. To
refresh them when a conference publishes a new template:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_paper_styles.py            # all venues
python3 scripts/fetch_paper_styles.py iclr icml  # just these
```

Building a PDF needs `latexmk` and a TeX Live install; on Debian the COLM
template additionally needs `texlive-fonts-extra`. Loom reports a missing style
file by name rather than dumping the LaTeX log.

**Kernel Lab needs a separate bundle.** The Kernel Hub stack (Dockerfiles,
compose files, the `kernel_evaluator` service and its CUDA reference docs) is
~800 files, so it ships in the source tree but *not* in the installed package.
It works out of the box from a git checkout; a pipx/venv install needs to be
pointed at one:

```bash
export LOOM_KERNEL_HUB_DIR=/path/to/Loom-checkout/loom/kernel_hub
```

`loom doctor` reports whether the bundle was found.

## OpenClaw integration

Loom can push events to an OpenClaw gateway. The headline
use is the **run monitor**: you get pinged (e.g. in Slack) whenever an agent
stops and is waiting for input, and your reply is sent straight back into its
pane.

### Enable it

Launch Loom pointing at the **`/hooks/agent`** endpoint — message **delivery is
on by default**. (The lighter `/hooks/wake` endpoint only *wakes* the gateway
and does **not** post a message, so use `/hooks/agent`.)

```bash
loom web --project /path/to/project \
  --openclaw \
  --openclaw-url http://127.0.0.1:18789/hooks/agent \
  --openclaw-token <gateway-token> \
  --openclaw-debug            # logs each POST + HTTP status
```

Add `--openclaw-channel <#channel>` or `--openclaw-to <user>` if your gateway
needs an explicit destination. (Full flag list: `loom/cli.py`.)

### What Loom sends

Loom emits lifecycle events — `task-created`, `claude-start` / `claude-stop`,
`worktree-created`, … — and, when a task's **Monitor** toggle is on, an
`agent-stopped` event each time that agent finishes a turn / waits for input,
carrying the last lines of the pane for context. The stop is detected by
watching the agent's "working" hint (`esc to interrupt`) and firing when it
disappears, so it does not depend on any particular "done" wording.

### Replying back into the pane

Your OpenClaw agent continues a task by calling Loom's inbound endpoint:

```
POST /api/tasks/<slug>/claude/send   {"text": "check the current pods", "submit": true}
```

It types the message into that task's live agent pane (auth header +
`?project=<id>` apply). The full loop is: **agent stops → OpenClaw pings you →
you reply → the reply lands in the pane → the agent continues → repeat.**

### Gateway on another host

If OpenClaw runs elsewhere, bridge the two with an SSH reverse tunnel from the
Loom machine, then point OpenClaw at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`:

```bash
ssh -f -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 -R 8765:127.0.0.1:8765 user@gateway-host
```

The bundled `loom/skills/remote_control/` skill documents the full Loom
HTTP API for an OpenClaw agent (auth, project scoping, reading panes, sending
text, etc.).
